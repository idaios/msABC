	 *** objective: Simulate 10 times, 6 (independent) loci. Sample size
is variable among loci

The length of the loci is variable as well.


The file fragments.txt describes the configuration of the loci:


id	n	length	pop
f1	12	1000	0
f2	10	500	1
f2	9	500	2
f3	12	100	0
f4	12	2200	0
f5	12	1000	0	
f6	6	100	1
f6	17	100	2

NOTICE!!!! for the loci that the sample size is 12 we use pop=0. 
		 for the rest of the loci (where n != 12) we should specify the sample size
for each of the populations. The order of the information is important.

Polymorphism data are stored in tempoutput_ms.txt.
The parameter values with the summary statistics are stored in out.txt.

Each line represents a different replication. The first line is a header.

A logfile log.txt is created which contains the command line.




Parameters:
------------

p_theta : the value of parameter theta used in the simulations. It is constant.
p_rho   : the value of parameter rho. It is drawn from U(10; 20)
p_npop  : the number of sub-populations
p_isl_totmig  : the total migration rate   
p_em_time_pops_1_2    : time that the migration size changes. It is constant (=0.1)  
p_mig_1_2       : the new migration rate for sub-populations 1 and 2. It drawn from a prior U(0.1; 0.5)
p_pop_change_time       : the time that the total population size changes. It is drawn from a prior U(0.01; 0.02)
p_pop_change_newpop     : the ratio of the changed population to the population at the present

***********************************************
IMPORTANT: theta AND rho values in the command line refer to a locus of length 1000 (as it is specified by the nsites).
----------
This number is rescaled for each of the loci (since their length may vary).
***********************************************

NOTICE!! 

1. When pop == 0, then the n should be equal to the total n given in the 
command line. Also, the sample configuration is the one given in the command
line.

2. When pop != 0, then information for ALL subpopulations is required. 
The order is important. It is supposed that first information is given
for sub-population 1, then for sub-population 2 etc. See the next example.
Then, the total sample size is the sum of the samples of the demes.
