	 *** objective: Simulate 10 times, 2 (independent) loci. Sample size
is variable among loci. 
	 	 print out only the Tajima's D as a summary statistic (for each subpopulation)

Define the summary statistics
------------------------------
You may define in a file (here options.txt) that is denoted after the --options
flag, the summary statistics that you wish to print out. 
Notice that if private summary statistics for each subpopulation are printed,
then the summary statistic for the global sample is printed as well.


The samples originate from two populations. For the first locus 24 lines are from each population.
For the second locus 24 lines are derived from the first population and 23 lines from the second.

Data includes incomplete information, i.e. in the observed fasta alignment there are 'N's.

workflow
--------
1. use the script missing_ms_report.pl to obtain the information about the missing data. 
	 this script will transform in continuous form the missing positions.
	 this script should run for each of the loci:

	 missing_ms_report.pl in=locus1.fa > locus1.missing
	 missing_ms_report.pl in=locus2.fa > locus2.missing

Then, we create a list that contains the files that describe the missing information:
	 echo "locus1.missing" > missing.list
	 echo "locus2.missing" >> missing.list

the file missing.list will be used in the command line of msABC after the flag --missing


Polymorphism data are stored in tempoutput_ms.txt.
NOTICE!!!! : the polymorphism data contain except 0 and 1, the state 2, which is the missing information.


The parameter values with the summary statistics are stored in out.txt.

Each line represents a different replication. The first line is a header.

A logfile log.txt is created which contains the command line.

Parameters
----------
p_npop : the number of sub-populations
p_isl_totmig : the total migration rate
p_theta : the value of parameter theta used in the simulations. It is constant.
p_rho : the value of parameter rho. It is constant.
p_en_time_pop_2 : the time at which the population 2 changes size.
p_en_size_pop_2 : the new size of population 2.

Summaries
---------
s_average_tajd_1 : the average Tajima's D for sub-population 1
s_variance_tajd_1 : the variance of Tajima's D for sub-population 1
s_average_tajd_2 : the average of Tajima's D for sub-population 2
s_variance_tajd_2 : the variance of Tajima's D for sub-population 2
s_average_tajd : the average of Tajima's D for the total sample
s_variance_tajd : the variance of Tajima's D for the total sample


***********************************************
IMPORTANT: theta AND rho values in the command line refer to a locus of length 1000 (as it is specified by the nsites).
----------
This number is rescaled for each of the loci (since their length may vary).
***********************************************

NOTICE!! 

1. When pop == 0, then the n should be equal to the total n given in the 
command line. Also, the sample configuration is the one given in the command
line.

2. When pop != 0, then information for ALL subpopulations is required. 
The order is important. It is supposed that first information is given
for sub-population 1, then for sub-population 2 etc. See the next example.
Then, the total sample size is the sum of the samples of the demes.
