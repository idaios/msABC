#First create an "observed data file". Here, I create that using ms,
# but I pretend that the data is observed. THe data is stored in
# obs.out

ms 10 5 -t 10 > obs.out

#Now use the msABC but instead of simulating data, 
#calculate summary statistics from the obs.out.
#Notice that the command line is the same like the normal msABC
#There is no need to give theta, rho, effective population size

msABC
