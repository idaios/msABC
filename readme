Compilation
------------
The compiled executable is included in this directory. 
We used gcc 4.2.4 in a 32-bit ubuntu 8.04 Linux machine to compile the source code.




!!!! Please remember to remove the *.o files (if any), i.e. make clean, if you compile in different architecture than 32-bits !!!!
**********************************************************************************************************

If you need to compile it again just run in the terminal:

make clean
make


We have tested the code in 32-bit ubuntu 8.04, 64-bit debian (with gcc 4.1.2) and 64-bit ubuntu. 


--> Please try out the demonstration code (see below). It contains some detailed examples that you may run using msABC.

----------- D E M O N S T R A T I O N -----------------------


In the directory there is a demo.sh file
 which will run 8 different examples of msABC. 

***** please type ./demo.sh (or bash demo.sh) to create the examples ***

8 directories (example1 - example8) will be created, which contain:

readme.txt: the readme file for the example
out.txt: output of summary statistics
log.txt: the command line used to generate data
tempoutput_ms.txt: the polymorphic data
seedms: the seeds used to generate data (also in the command line)
